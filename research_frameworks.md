As a Principal Architect, you're expected to operate at a high strategic level while still having deep technical breadth. That means you should be familiar with a range of **frameworks** that touch on architecture, systems thinking, governance, delivery, and innovation. Here‚Äôs a list of key frameworks ‚Äî grouped by category ‚Äî that Principal Architects **know, use, or adapt** regularly:

---

### üèóÔ∏è **Enterprise Architecture Frameworks**

These define how to structure and align business and IT strategy:

1. **TOGAF (The Open Group Architecture Framework)**

   * Standardized approach for designing, planning, implementing, and governing enterprise architecture.
   * Uses ADM (Architecture Development Method) cycle.
   * Covers Business, Application, Data, and Technology architecture layers.

2. **Zachman Framework**

   * A taxonomy rather than a methodology.
   * Focuses on understanding different perspectives (Planner, Owner, Designer, Builder, etc.).

3. **FEAF (Federal Enterprise Architecture Framework)**

   * U.S. government framework, but adaptable to private enterprise.
   * Emphasizes segment and performance architecture.

4. **Gartner Enterprise Architecture Framework**

   * More pragmatic than TOGAF.
   * Aligns business outcomes with architecture practice.

### üß† **Software & Solution Architecture Frameworks**

These focus on system/component design and decision-making at the implementation level:

5. **C4 Model (Context, Container, Component, Code)**

   * Clean way to document architecture visually at different levels of abstraction.

6. **ARC42**

   * Template for software architecture documentation.
   * Lightweight and useful in Agile environments.

7. **The 4+1 View Model**

   * Logical, development, process, physical, and use-case views.
   * Classic approach used in UML and formal architecture reviews.

8. **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**

   * Strategic design methodology to align software architecture with business domains.
   * Key for microservices and complex business systems.

---

### üîÑ **Delivery, DevOps, and Lifecycle Frameworks**

Architects increasingly must consider delivery models and ops constraints:

9. **SAFe (Scaled Agile Framework)**

   * Blends Agile, Lean, and DevOps at scale.
   * Architects participate in "Enablers" and solution-level planning.

10. **Spotify Model**

    * Squad/tribe/chapter/guild structure.
    * Emphasizes autonomy, alignment, and fast flow.

11. **ITIL / ITSM Frameworks**

    * For architects involved in service design or platform ops.
    * Helps define SLAs, service catalogs, etc.

12. **SRE (Site Reliability Engineering) Principles**

    * Architecture must factor in SLOs, error budgets, observability, etc.

---

### üõ°Ô∏è **Security & Risk Frameworks**

Architects at scale must build secure systems by design:

13. **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)**

    * Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover.
    * Especially useful for regulated industries.

14. **Zero Trust Architecture**

    * Assumes breach, enforces least privilege and segmentation.
    * Highly relevant in cloud-native environments.

15. **OWASP SAMM (Software Assurance Maturity Model)**

    * Helps you benchmark and evolve secure software development practices.

---

### üìä **Business & Innovation Frameworks**

These help align architecture with business goals and change:

16. **Business Capability Mapping**

    * Ties architecture to business outcomes.
    * Useful for prioritizing investments and managing change.

17. **BMC (Business Model Canvas)**

    * Simple strategic planning tool used for aligning new initiatives.

18. **Wardley Mapping**

    * Strategic tool that maps capabilities by maturity and value chain.
    * Excellent for planning modernization or innovation.

19. **Lean Startup / Innovation Accounting**

    * Helps architect for experimentation and validate outcomes in early-stage initiatives.

---

### üìê **Cloud and Infrastructure Architecture Frameworks**

For architects in cloud-native, hybrid, or edge environments:

20. **AWS Well-Architected Framework**

21. **Azure Well-Architected Framework**

22. **Google Cloud Architecture Framework**

    * All emphasize pillars like reliability, security, cost optimization, performance, and operational excellence.

23. **TAM (Technology Adoption Models)**

    * Used for guiding rollouts across internal or external customers.

---

### üß¨ **AI/ML Architecture and Agentic System Patterns**

Given your role:

24. **ML System Design Patterns (e.g., from Google‚Äôs ‚ÄúRules of ML‚Äù)**
25. **Agent System Patterns (e.g., Autonomy levels, LLMOps, Human-in-the-loop)**

    * Crucial for modern intelligent systems.
